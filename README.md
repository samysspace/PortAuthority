# PortAuthority
>üö¢A simple and flexible Flask web app to scan ports on any IP address or domain

PortAuthority is a simple network utility made with Flask that allows you to input an IP address or domain and range of ports, and get back the ports that are open within that range at that address. Think Nmap except without all the bells and whistles. 

# Install
Installation is simple. Make sure you have the most recent version of Flask downloaded and then simply run the following command:
```shell
FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
```
Now you are good to go! Have fun port scanning!
